# iTwitter
### Express, React, Node, Twitter API
#### Currently not working because Heroku removed their free plan ðŸ˜€ working on deploying it elsewhere!
Turn your Twitter timeline into an iMessage groupchat for max chaos. Enjoy!

Built with: Express, React, NodeJS

### Usage Notes & Caveats
- Timeline doesn't update automatically; infinite scroll is activated by scrolling downwards at the bottom of the feed
- There's a small lag between when likes & unlikes are registered by the Twitter api, so scrolling / refreshing immediately after liking / unliking may cause the app to display the false status for a liked / unliked Tweet
- No retweet functionality, no replies (might accidentally subtweet), no deleting Tweets
- Basically SMS, text-only
- Logout doesn't work as expected, must close entire browser session
- Will work on it more when I have time! But feel free to try / break / fix stuff & make a PR, some suggestions are below

### TODO
- Fix logout bug
- Item nesting in GrayMessage.js and BlueMessage.js and corresponding CSS in Message.css are quite messy, can be cleaned up
- Perhaps add retweet functionality later (retweet twice = no effect); see icons in "options-unused"
- Maybe add unfollowing functionality â€” "remove from groupchat" â€” but this might be weird because removing from groupchat is
  two-way, unfollowing isn't
  - Counterpoint: the app displays Tweets from followings, which are not necessarily two-way anyway
- Swipe left to see timestamps on messages (in general, better animations â€” perhaps using react-use-gesture and react-spring)
  - Another animation idea: tweeting / sending message: similar animation as when sending iMessage
  - Another animation idea: nonlinear - decrease speed over duration of single scroll
- Style scrollbar like iMessage's (thin & gray bar)
- Double-tap header to scroll to top
- Autosizing textarea should actually push the entire stream of Tweets upwards, not cover them)
- Add error-handling for liking / unliking / Tweeting
- Add functionality for deleting Tweets
